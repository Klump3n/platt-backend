Usage
=====

Call ``main.py -h`` for a little help.

With the provided example data in the programs main directory, a viable command
would be

``main.py -d example_data``.

This would start the backend, which in turn would look for simulation data in
the directory ``example_data``. A web server would also be started. This we
could reach at ``http://localhost:8008``.
