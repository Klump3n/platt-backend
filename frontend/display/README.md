# WebGL frontend for fem-gl
Displays data that has been generated by 
[fem-gl-backend](https://github.com/Klump3n/fem-gl-backend).
Drag the mouse over the model to rotate, hold CTRL while mouse-drag to translate
the model and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Mostly rudimentary, but it
kind of works.

This relies on [twgl.js](https://github.com/greggman/twgl.js/) to keep the 
number of WebGL boilerplate lines low.
